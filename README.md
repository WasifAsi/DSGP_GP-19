# Shoreline Change Analysis Using Deep Learning

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing shoreline changes using satellite imagery and deep learning techniques. Unlike traditional GIS-based methods, we calculate shoreline change rates such as the End Point Rate (EPR) and Net Shoreline Movement (NSM) using binary masks generated by deep learning models.

## Key Features
- **Deep Learning-Based Segmentation**: Utilizes models such as DeepLabV3 to generate binary masks of shorelines.
- **Shoreline Change Calculation**: Computes EPR and NSM directly from binary masks without relying on ArcGIS or other GIS tools.
- **Heavy Data Augmentation**: Enhances training datasets to improve model performance.
- **Interactive Web Interface**: A React-based frontend that allows users to upload and analyze images.
- **Flask Backend API**: Processes images and runs the analysis pipeline.
- **AI Chatbot Assistant**: Answers questions about shoreline erosion and coastal management.

## System Architecture

### Frontend
- Built with React and TypeScript
- Features a responsive, user-friendly interface
- Provides step-by-step visualization of the analysis process
- Allows users to upload exactly 2 satellite images for comparison
- Displays analysis results with downloadable reports

### Backend
- Flask API that handles image processing and analysis
- Integrates multiple deep learning models for shoreline detection
- Calculates shoreline change metrics (EPR and NSM)
- Generates comprehensive analysis reports
- Returns visualization data for the frontend

### Chatbot
- Built using a rasa
- Provides information about shoreline erosion, coastal management, and climate change impacts
- Assists users in understanding analysis results
- Offers recommendations based on shoreline change data

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Acquire satellite imagery of coastal regions.
   - Apply data augmentation to enhance model training.
   
2. **Shoreline Segmentation**
   - Train deep learning models to generate binary shoreline masks.
   
3. **Shoreline Change Computation**
   - Extract shorelines from binary masks.
   - Calculate shoreline movement metrics:
     - **EPR (End Point Rate)**: Measures shoreline change rate over time.
     - **NSM (Net Shoreline Movement)**: Calculates the absolute movement of shorelines.
   
4. **Visualization & Analysis**
   - Display results in a user-friendly webpage.
   - Compare different model performances.
